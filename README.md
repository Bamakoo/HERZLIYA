### About the Project 

This Project was built by [Audrey CARMONT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/o-drey-carmont/) with some help from [Emma GAUBERT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-gaubert/). 
Two goals were pursued with this project :

- Improve author's knowledge of the Swift programming language.
- Build and deploy a Vapor backend. 
- Learn a little bit of SwiftUI (the mobile client is built entirely using this framework).
