# Project HERZLIYA

## The Ultimate peer to peer bookselling marketplace

### About the Project 

This Project was built by [Audrey CARMONT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/o-drey-carmont/) with some help from [Emma GAUBERT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-gaubert/). 

The main goals were pursued with this project are as follows:

- Improve author's knowledge of the Swift and JavaScript programming languages.
- Build and deploy a Vapor backend. 
- Gain further understanding of the complex web of interactions between a Server and a Client. 
- Learn a little bit of SwiftUI (the mobile client is built entirely using this framework). 

### What the project is

As a Product, HERZLIYA is fundamentally a marketplace that allows users to purchase, buy and sell books amongst each other. 
Technically, it makes heavy use of Swift's latest Concurrency features. 

### Contributions

Although we appreciate the sentiment, this project is not currently open to contributions. It is used to showcase our skills. 
We have no plans of opening it up to contributions in short or even long term.
